    "A basic assumption of many classifications schemes is linear separability (see earlier notes). This assumption will lead to poor classification performance in cases that aren't separable by some hyperplane. A similar problem arises for decision trees and forests when the features don't align well along the coordinate axes of the feature space. The situation becomes quite clear in [this comparison](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-classifier-comparison-py) from the scikit-learn website:\n",

    "Linear SVM (3rd column) does very well for the linearly separable case (last row), but is really troubled with the Yin-Yang and the inside-outside cases (first and second row). In contrast, trees and forests (6th and 7th columns) present boxy approximations, but generally follow he features quite well. Much smoother approximations can be had from a SVM that uses Radial Basis Functions as kernels (4th column) and neural nets (8th column).\n",

    "The key to both is that they use non-linear transformation of the data, which results in curved decision boundaries. Let's look in detail how neural networks do that.\n",

    "When we want to approximate the mapping $X\\rightarrow Y$ as observed with $N$ samples $\\lbrace x_i,y_i\\rbrace, x_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^D,y_i\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we first need to account for the dimensionality difference and then for the unknown behavior of the mapping. The first problem can trivially solved by projecting the samples $x $ onto some basis $w$, the second by allowing any function with scalar arguments. Combined this gives us the regression function $\\tilde{y}_i = g(w^\\top x_i)$, which already provides quite some flexibility. But we can do *a lot* better by using multiple of those regressors and combining them:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde{y}_i = \\sum_k^K g_k(w_k^\\top x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It is clear that with $K\\rightarrow\\infty$ an enormous class of mappings can be approximated, which is why this form is called a **universal approximator**. It is limited, however, to mixtures of scalar functions, but that is really the only restriction. The optimization would have to determine the $w_k$ *and* the functions $g_k$. The concept is known as [projection pursuit regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_pursuit_regression), and we will not into details.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we now replace the unknown function $g_k$ with a known and fixed function $\\sigma$, we get a set of intermediate variables\n",

Similarly, the general behavior of the other types that redshift increases from left to right is well captured. But there are obviously regions with non-sensical estimates of $z<-0.5$. That's because there were no training data to put any penalty on such solutions. In essence, the non-linear nature of the networks means that there can be arbitrary extrapolation errors. It's therefore best to avoid areas with few or no training data.\n",
