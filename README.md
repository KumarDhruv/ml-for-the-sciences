# Data Science in Astronomy

*The material in this repo is part of a seminar at Princeton University. Feel free to use it as you like*.

## Schedule

The seminar starts out with several lecture-style meetings on the fundamentals of machine learning and data science. It'll be mixed up with code demonstrations and paper discussions from recent astrostatistics literature.

### The "Lecture"

* [Introduction](Introduction.ipynb) and [Introductory Example](clustering/multiband-segmentation.ipynb)
* [Kernel density estimation](density-estimation/1-Kernel-density-estimation.ipynb)
* [(Gaussian) mixture models](density-estimation/2-Gaussian-Mixture-Models.ipynb)
* [Mixture model applications](density-estimation/3-Mixture-model-applications.md)
* [Clustering](clustering/algorithms-cluster-number.ipynb)

### Miscellaneous Topics
* [Flux estimation and its priors](bayesian-fluxes/bayesian-fluxes.ipynb)
* [A (non-traditional) introduction to TensorFlow](https://github.com/dfm/tf-tutorial)
