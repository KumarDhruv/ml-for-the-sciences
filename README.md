# Machine Learning for the Sciences

*The material in this repo is part of a seminar at Princeton University. Feel free to use it as you like*.

## Approach

The seminar started out with several lecture-style meetings on the fundamentals of machine learning and data science. From there, it covers code demonstrations, research projects, and paper discussions from recent literature.

### The "Lecture"

* [Introduction](Introduction.ipynb) and [Introductory Example](clustering/multiband-segmentation.ipynb)
* [Kernel density estimation](density-estimation/1-Kernel-density-estimation.ipynb)
* [(Gaussian) mixture models](density-estimation/2-Gaussian-Mixture-Models.ipynb)
* [Mixture model applications](density-estimation/3-Mixture-model-applications.md)
* [Clustering](clustering/algorithms-cluster-number.ipynb)
* [Classification overview](classification/1-Classification.ipynb) and [Theory for linearly separable cases](classification/2-Linear-Theory.ipynb)
* [Neural networks 101](networks/1-nn-photo-z.ipynb) and [PyTorch introduction](networks/2-pytorch-intro.ipynb)
